        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I have always had a good understanding of technology and a desire to learn more about it. I have spent a significant amount of time focused on web developement. I am currently enrolled in Treehouse's Techdegree program. I have also earned an Associate's degree from Palm Beach State College.</p>
        <p>Through my studies I have a good working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have taken courses on jQuery, SEO and many others. My goal is to continue to learn and develop my skills so that I can be an asset to a web team!</p>

        <h2>Life Experience</h2>
        <p>I am in recovery and I have learned many valuable lessons from my past. Today I recognize service and hard work as key parts in my life.</p>
        <p>I have worked for a church and in the substance abuse treatment industry. I feel that through my work I was able to give back and I hope that I can do the same through helping good businesses succeed so that they can help others.</p>
